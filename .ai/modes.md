# Modes

Everything there is to play besides versus and story mode. **Read before changing a mode, or
adding one.** Versus is "Rules of a match" in `fighting-design.md`; story mode is `story-mode.md`.

All of these went in on Eric's call (2026-10-29). The main menu's fourth card, **More modes**
(`ModesScreen`), opens four of them; each sets `GameRoot.Mode` and goes on to fighter select,
which picks for that mode. The main menu puts the mode back to versus. `--modes` boots to the
More modes screen and `--mode=training|boss|targets|doodle` makes fighter select and a `--match`
that mode's.

## Versus rules

The options' **Versus rules** button steps round three ways to win a versus fight
(`GameOptions.Rule`, `StepRules`): **lives** (1 to 5, the default, as before), **time** (2, 3 or 5
minutes) and **health** (100, 150 or 200).
